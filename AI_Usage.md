### AI-Assisted Development: A Collaborative Approach

My development process for this project was a partnership with AI, leveraging large language models like Gemini for foundational work and using them as a powerful tool for enhancement and refinement. My workflow can be broken down into three key areas:

#### 1. Foundational Code & Structure

- **Template and Boilerplate**: I used AI models, including Gemini, to rapidly generate the initial structure and boilerplate code for the application. This included setting up the basic React component hierarchy, file organization, and establishing the foundational API call structure. This allowed me to quickly move past the setup phase and focus on the core logic.
- **UI Library Integration**: I leveraged AI to find and integrate specialized UI libraries like **Aceternity UI**, **React Bits**, and others. The AI provided guidance on installation, prop usage, and component customization, saving significant time I would have spent scouring documentation.

### 2. UI/UX and Component Refinement

- **Responsive Design**: The initial responsive layouts were created with the help of AI, which generated the correct Tailwind CSS media queries and flexbox/grid structures. I then enhanced these designs with minor personal tweaks to ensure perfect pixel alignment and a polished user experience on all screen sizes.
- **Aesthetic Enhancements**: The AI helped conceptualize and write the code for custom components, such as the `Orb` background. It provided the initial ideas and code snippets, which I then refined to fit the project's specific aesthetic and performance requirements.

### 3. Debugging and Advanced Logic

- **GSAP Animations**: I handled all the **GSAP animations myself**, from the hero section's title reveal to the scroll-triggered animations in the `Uploader` component. The core logic, timelines, and `ScrollTrigger` setup were my own work. However, when a bug arose—specifically, a conflict with a previous AI-generated snippet—I used Gemini as a debugging tool to analyze the problem and validate my solution. This confirmed that a single `ScrollTrigger` on a parent timeline was the correct and most robust approach.
- **Logic Validation**: For complex logic, such as the mock API's exponential backoff and `AbortController` implementation, I used AI to validate my code and check for potential edge cases, ensuring the functionality was both robust and error-free.
